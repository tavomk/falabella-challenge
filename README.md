# Falabella - Challenge Fullstack Developer

Gustavo Mu√±oz

Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100.
The numbers must be shown on a React front-end application.
However, for multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Falabella". For
multiples of 5 print "IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5,
print "Marketplace".
But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary
operators or `else`.

# Requirements
* 1 `if`.
* You can't use `else`, `else if` or ternary.
* Unit tests.
* Feel free to apply your SOLID knowledge.
* You can write the challenge in PHP or JavaScript/TypeScript language.
* One git branch for the solution.
* One git branch for the documentation.
